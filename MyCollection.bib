abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of emergency MRI in the diagnosis of acute spinal injuries, and to correlate the MRI pattern with the neurological outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with MRI-proven spinal cord injury were classified according to the Frankel classification. MRI was always performed within 8 hours from trauma. Frankel classification divides spinal cord injuries into 5 classes of decreasing severity based on the presence of motor and/or sensory function loss. On the basis of the MRI findings the patients were classified in 3 groups: group 1 (intramedullary haematoma), group 2 (multi-metamer oedema), group 3 (single-metamer oedema). All patients underwent neurosurgery and were clinically evaluated until the stabilization of neurological recovery. Mean follow-up time was 12 months. The MR images were retrospectively evaluated and correlated to the neurological outcome. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients showed complete motor loss (Frankel classes A and B); of these 28 patients 12 (42.8{\%}) had MRI evidence of intramedullary haematoma, 12 (42.8{\%}) had multi-metamer oedema and 4 (14.4{\%}) had single-metamer oedema. Of the 10 patients with incomplete motor loss, none had MRI evidence of haemorrhage, 4 (40{\%}) showed multi-metamer oedema and 6 (60{\%}) showed single-metamer oedema. Follow-up clinical assessment revealed that 14/38 patients (36,8{\%}) had clinical improvement and 2/38 cases (5{\%}) had a complete motor recovery, as demonstrated by the move to a higher Frankel class. CONCLUSIONS: Our results, consistent with previous reports, confirm a strong correlation between the MRI appearance of traumatic spinal cord injuries in acute phase and long-term recovery of motor and sensory function: patients with initial haemorrhage had a poor prognosis, whereas those with spinal cord oedema had a good clinical outcome, as demonstrated by the passage to a higher Frankel class. MRI is particularly important in the initial evaluation of unconscious patients who cannot undergo a motor and sensory neurological evaluation, and to define the prognosis, which will influence the correct therapeutic choice},

abstract = {It was reported that CXCR4 signaling played an important role in the migration and differentiation of endogenous neural stem cells after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the molecular mechanism of it is still unclear. Here, we established a model of SCI in rats and AMD3100 was used to treat them. The rats were then sacrificed and the injured spinal cord specimens were harvested. Additionally, the neural stem cells (NSCs) line was culture and treated with AMD3100 in vitro. Results showed the locomotor function of SCI rats was worse after treated with AMD3100. And the expression levels of Nestion in neural stem cells and $\beta$-tubulin in neuron cells were significantly increased in the injured spinal cord, which can be inhibited by the CXCR4 antagonist of AMD3100. Additionally, the expression of $\beta$-catenin and phosphorylase $\beta$-catenin protein was significantly down regulated by AMD3100. In vitro, the NSCs proliferation ability was inhibited and the migration was decreased after treated with AMD3100. Also, the expression of Nestion, $\beta$-tubulin, $\beta$-catenin and phosphorylase $\beta$-catenin protein was significantly decreased in AMD3100 group comparing with untreated group. Taken together, this study suggested that AMD3100 could inhibit the migration and differentiation of endogenous neural stem cells in rats with SCI. The mechanism of it maybe that AMD3100 could down regulate of SDF-1/CXCR4 by targeting $\beta$-catenin signaling pathway.},

abstract = {The usual treatment of bacterial abscesses, except lung or tubo-ovarian abscesses, includes therapeutic drainage. Increasing evidence suggests that some abscesses respond to antimicrobial therapy without drainage. To study this issue, a MEDLINE search of the literature (1966-1994) was performed for cases of bacterial abscess in which treatment without definitive drainage was attempted. Four hundred sixty-five cases were identified. The most commonly involved organs were the liver, brain, and kidney. The success rate of antimicrobial therapy was 85.9{\%}. Factors that predicted a less favorable outcome were abscess diameter of {\textgreater} or = 5 cm (odds ratio [OR] = 37.7; P = .0003), involvement of {\textgreater} or = 1 organism (OR = 5.2; P = .014), presence of gram-negative bacilli (OR = 3.4; P = .022), length of therapy of {\textless} 4 weeks (OR = 49.1; P {\textless} .0001), and use of an aminoglycoside as the only active agent (OR = 11.8; P = .008). Many bacterial abscesses can be treated without drainage; abscess size, the organisms involved, and therapy utilized may influence outcome.},
